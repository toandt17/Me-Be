YITH WooCommerce Color and Label Variations replaces the dropdown select of your variable products with Colors and Labels

== Description ==

Replace the WooCommerce default select and use color swatches, images, and labels to show the options available on your products
In your e-commerce, you sell products that are available in different variations (sizes, colors, patterns, etc.); for each variation, WooCommerce inserts a "select," which is a drop-down menu with the list of all the options selectable by users on your product pages.
This is a compromising solution for your shop aesthetics since it is not user-friendly and can be an obstacle to sales: imagine how frustrating the experience can be for a customer who has to choose the color of a T-shirt by selecting it from a list with simple texts without the visual support of color swatches.
YITH WooCommerce Color, Image & Label Variation Swatches is a plugin that allows you to replace WooCommerce selects with icons, custom images and dynamic labels. Size, color, fabric type, stone shape, buttons color, size of a necklace...regardless of the product you sell, this tool is an effective and free solution to better represent the options available for your products and offer your customers a better shopping experience.

== Main features ==

* Create “Color swatches” attributes

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible.
If you are using the premium version of the plugin, we invite you ask for assistance in our support desk.

= How many attributes can I use for each product ? =

There’s no limit in the amount of attributes you may use. You can create many variations for each product using the configured attributes.

= My users found some issues when selecting attributes on products. They cannot switch from one attribute to the other of the same type. =

This is a known issue, which does not depend on a malfunctioning, though,, but on the fact that WooCommerce requires the chosen attribute to be deselected before another of the same type could be selected.


== Installation ==

**Important**: First of all, you have to download and activate [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) plugin, because without it YITH Color and Label Variations for WooCommerce cannot work.
